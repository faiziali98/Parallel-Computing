# Cardiac Electrophysiology Simulation

I have added code for 1D and 2D version of the assignment in files:

1. cardiacsim.C (2D)
2. cardiacsim_1D.C (1D)

You can run the code using commands:

make
mpirun -n (number of threads) ./cardiacsim -n (grid size) -t (time step)

To run serial code, copy the code from cardiacsimSerial.C to cardiacsim.C, in arch.gnu
comment the MPI flag and then run:

make
./cardiacsim -n (grid size) -t (time step)

For now, I had to copy the code to compile the code, try to change the 
make file so that we do not need that

Last but not least, we still have to:

1. Use openMP
2. Optamize the code according to the last few lectures
3. Test the code
